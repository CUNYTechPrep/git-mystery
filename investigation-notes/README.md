# Investigation Notes

This directory is for YOUR investigation findings!

As you discover clues, create files here to document:
- Suspicious commits
- Timeline of events
- Evidence contradictions  
- Your theories

When you're ready to make an accusation, create a file called `accusation.md` with:
1. Who did it
2. When they did it
3. How they did it
4. Why they did it
5. Your evidence

Good luck, detective!
