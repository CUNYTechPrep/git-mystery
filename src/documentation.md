# Revolutionary Algorithm Documentation

## Overview
The Revolutionary Algorithm represents a breakthrough in computational efficiency, achieving O(log n) complexity for operations that traditionally require O(nÂ²) time.

## Key Features
- Parallel processing capabilities
- Dynamic optimization based on data characteristics  
- Self-adjusting efficiency ratios
- Secure hash-based chunk identification

## Usage
```python
from algorithm import RevolutionaryAlgorithm

algo = RevolutionaryAlgorithm()
result = algo.process_data(your_data)
```

## Performance Metrics
- 10x faster than traditional approaches
- Memory efficient
- Scalable to millions of data points

## Security Notes
This algorithm contains proprietary optimization techniques. All code must remain confidential.
