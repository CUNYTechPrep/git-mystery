Subject: Can't believe it

Mike,

They're offering me almost double. But the algorithm we've been working on... Professor Git would never forgive me. Still, with the baby on the way and the mortgage...

What would you do?

Subject: Did you see Alex today?

Marcus,

Is it just me or is Alex acting strange today? He seemed really nervous in the morning standup.

Also, great work on those test cases!

Yeah, he's been jumpy all week. Probably just stress from the project deadline.

BTW, I'm heading to Rita's desk soon to get help with git. These commands are confusing!
