The revolutionary algorithm.py file is MISSING!

This file contained months of research and is worth millions. 
I need someone to investigate immediately.

Check the git history, review the evidence, and find out:
- WHO deleted the file
- WHEN it was deleted  
- WHY they did it

All evidence is in the case-files directory.
Use git commands to uncover the truth!
